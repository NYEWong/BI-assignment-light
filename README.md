## Case: Survey dashboard

For this BI assessment, we want you to create a dashboard, using the datafile provided. 
- Load the data in a store system.
- Create a dashboard where the averages are reported and you can drill through the hierarchy and answer distribution.

The goal of the assignment is to get an idea of your experience, creativity, and ability to learn, analyze and reason.<BR>
  
## Datafile

In the provided datafile you can find the raw data of the survey, the text of the questions is located on the questionnaire tab.<BR>

## Tech stack

It is recommended to stay close to Effectory’s tech stack. So we get a better understanding of how you fit within our current product portfolio. More specifically, we suggest you use the Microsoft BI stack/ Azure and Power BI.<BR>

## Expectations
Depending on your degree of experience, we would like to see some creative ideas integrated in your solution. This is entirely up to you, and you can choose anything you want to enrich your solution. Some examples include
- ETL process.
- A dashboard with logical results

You can spend as much time as you want on it, but in the end we expect a sufficient, working solution. And that you can explain how you approached this assignment and why you made some decisions.
